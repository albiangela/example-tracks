The videos were collected in the facilities of the Department of Collective Behavior at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and The Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour (CASCB) at the University of Konstanz. 

The filename uses the convention animal_YYYYMMDD_N_fr
Where:
- animal identifies the tracked individual (e.g. locust but can be a non-animal, too) 
- N is for the number of filmed individuals
- fr is the original frame rate at which videos were recorded


Video Set 1: Hexbugs
1. hexbug_20250129_5_50fps.mp4
This is a video of 2:47 minutes of 5 hexbugs in a 60cm diameter custom-built arena. The video was originally recorded at 50 frames per second but the playback in this file is set to 30 frames per second.

2. locusts_20250117_5_5fps.mp4
This is a video of 1:35 minutes of 5 locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) in a 60cm diameter custom-built arena. The video was originally recorded at 5 frames per second but the playback in this file is set to 30 frames per second.

3. locusts_20250117_15_5fps.mp4
This is a video of 2:32 minutes of 15 locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) in a 60cm diameter custom-built arena. The video was originally recorded at 5 frames per second but the playback in this file is set to 30 frames per second.
