METHODS 

This document outlines the methods for each of the two video sets (Hexbugs, Locusts).
The videos were collected in the facilities of the Department of Collective Behavior at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and The Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour (CASCB) at the University of Konstanz. 

Video Set 1: Hexbugs

The video was recorded in January 2025 in the facilities of the Department of Collective Behavior at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and The Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour (CASCB), Konstanz, Germany. Five hexbugs were filmed in a 60cm diameter custom-built arena. The video was recorded in visible light (Norka Automation GmbH StroboMidi2) at 50 frames per second using a high-resolution camera (Kaya Instruments Iron253-CXP-M-IRF-C-N-NPT-CG) with a 25mm lens (Kowa LM25FC24M 25mm f/1.8). Data acquisition was controlled by a high-speed video recording software (Stream Pix 9, Norpix).

Video Set 2: Locusts

This set includes two videos, each recorded under the same experimental setup and environmental conditions. The settings (location, equipment, and overall process) remain consistent across the two videos. The videos were recorded in January 2025 in the facilities of the Department of Collective Behavior at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and The Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour (CASCB), Konstanz, Germany.

Locusts were filmed in a 60cm diameter custom-built arena. The video was recorded in visible light (Norka Automation GmbH StroboMidi2) at 5 frames per second using a high-resolution camera (Kaya Instruments Iron253-CXP-M-IRF-C-N-NPT-CG) with a 25mm lens (Kowa LM25FC24M 25mm f/1.8). Data acquisition was controlled by video recording software (Stream Pix 9, Norpix).
